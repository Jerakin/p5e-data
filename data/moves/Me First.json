  "Description": "When targeted by or in the area of effect of a move activated by a creature in range, you may use your reaction to copy the creature's move after activation but before the effects of the creature's move. If the move requires an attack roll, you have disadvantage on the attack. If the move requires a saving throw, the target(s) have advantage on the roll. If the move causes damage, double the damage dice. The damage/effect tier for the move is based off of your level, not the target's.",
